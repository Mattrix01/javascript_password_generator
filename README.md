Deployed application - https://mattrix01.github.io/javascript_password_generator/

## Technologies Used

- Javascript

## Steps taken

- I started with the array for each prompt, upper case, lower case etc.

- Then I pretended I knew the answers to the user input (in my example I console logged, value of 15 character length).

- Created for loop incrementing amount of times of characters, and each time grabbing a character out of the combined criteria defined by the users confirm selections.

- Each time the user said yes, I added that container into the combined array.

- I then returned the function value so that it gets displayed in the box via the password variable.
